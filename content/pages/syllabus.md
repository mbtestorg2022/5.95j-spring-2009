Classroom Routine
-----------------

At the beginning of each class, I answer questions from the feedback forms from the previous lesson. This activity helps me connect what you know with what you found confusing before starting on the next lesson. During the lesson, I ask questions and give you time to think about them before you respond. At the end of the lesson, I ask you to complete feedback forms for the lesson.
